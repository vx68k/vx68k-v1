* X68000 Executable loader.

An executable loader must be implemented.  The loader also have to
handle relocations.

Since Human68k is not loaded, an executable can be loaded at as low
address as 0x8000, so that unused memory can be reduced.

* Efficient CCR update.

Since CCR is normally updated more often than referenced, speed of CCR
update is important to improve system performance.

Deferred update seems difficult on m68k architecture.  Some bits in
CCR may not change by an instruction while others do, so its value
cannot be determined by the last operation.

M68k instructions can be categorized into three classes:
(1) that change all five bits in CCR,
(2) that change all bits except X, and
(3) that change Z only (bit test).

* Modular design.

Split X68000-specific code from generic m68k code.  Also GTK-dependent
code from platform-independent code.

* Non-square pixel graphics.

X68000 has some graphics modes where pixels are not square.  Aspect
ratio is approx. 3:2.  Run-time scaling may be needed.
