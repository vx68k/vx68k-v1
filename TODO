To-Do List for Virtual X68000

$Date: Thu, 18 Nov 1999 21:10:40 +0900 $

* Add comments about version information of libvm68k.la.

* Modify vx68k.texi generation as rglclock does.

* Rename directories for libraries as libXXX?

* Make LIBS empty for libvm68k.la.

* Use the GdkRgb visual.  This will initialize GdkRgb automagically.

* Implement key event handling to the GTK+ console.

* Better text VRAM emulation.

** Implement the text color map.

** Optimize the text VRAM drawing.

** Implement text scrolling, or at least prepare for it.

* Improve console device behaviour.

* Implement minimum FLOAT calls.

* Implement DOS calls _FILES and _NFILES.

* Implement DOS drives.  This will require some run-time
configuration.

Maybe version 1.1 or later

* IOCS function handlers.

* More DOS compatibility.

* More machine instructions.

* Instruction handlers must be changed into templates.

* The value of errno must be looked at for DOS calls.

* Efficient CCR update.  (Mostly done)

Since CCR is normally updated more often than referenced, speed of CCR
update is important to improve system performance.

Deferred update seems difficult on m68k architecture.  Some bits in
CCR may not change by an instruction while others do, so its value
cannot be determined by the last operation.

M68k instructions can be categorized into three classes:
(1) that change all five bits in CCR,
(2) that change all bits except X, and
(3) that change Z only (bit test).

* Modular design.

Split X68000-specific code from generic m68k code.  Also GTK-dependent
code from platform-independent code.

Version 1.2 or later

* Graphic VRAM emulation.

* Common case optimization.

Some common code sequences (strcpy, memcpy, etc.) can be optimized.

* Non-square pixel graphics.

X68000 has some graphics modes where pixels are not square.  Aspect
ratio is approx. 3:2.  Run-time scaling may be needed.
