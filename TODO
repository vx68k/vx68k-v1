TO DO

* Instructions must be implemented.

* DOS memory management

The DOS memory management must be implemented.  Currently, the
executable is loaded at a constant address.

* Efficient CCR update.

Since CCR is normally updated more often than referenced, speed of CCR
update is important to improve system performance.

Deferred update seems difficult on m68k architecture.  Some bits in
CCR may not change by an instruction while others do, so its value
cannot be determined by the last operation.

M68k instructions can be categorized into three classes:
(1) that change all five bits in CCR,
(2) that change all bits except X, and
(3) that change Z only (bit test).

* Modular design.

Split X68000-specific code from generic m68k code.  Also GTK-dependent
code from platform-independent code.

* Non-square pixel graphics.

X68000 has some graphics modes where pixels are not square.  Aspect
ratio is approx. 3:2.  Run-time scaling may be needed.
