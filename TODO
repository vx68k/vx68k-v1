Virtual X68000 TO DO

$Date: Fri, 09 Jul 1999 23:15:42 +0900 $

Version 0.36

* Video hardware emulation.

* Console device.

* `--one-thread' option.

This option may be useful to profile the code.

Version 0.36 or later

* IOCS handler.

* File name translation.

* More instructions must be implemented.

* Instruction handlers must be changed into templates.

* The value of errno must be looked at for DOS calls.

* Efficient CCR update.  (Mostly done)

Since CCR is normally updated more often than referenced, speed of CCR
update is important to improve system performance.

Deferred update seems difficult on m68k architecture.  Some bits in
CCR may not change by an instruction while others do, so its value
cannot be determined by the last operation.

M68k instructions can be categorized into three classes:
(1) that change all five bits in CCR,
(2) that change all bits except X, and
(3) that change Z only (bit test).

* Modular design.

Split X68000-specific code from generic m68k code.  Also GTK-dependent
code from platform-independent code.

Version 1.1 or later

* Common case optimization.

Some common code sequences (strcpy, memcpy, etc.) can be optimized.

* Non-square pixel graphics.

X68000 has some graphics modes where pixels are not square.  Aspect
ratio is approx. 3:2.  Run-time scaling may be needed.
