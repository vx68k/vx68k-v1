>> DESCRIPTION

Virtual X68000 is a software virtual machine, or an emulator, of Sharp
X68000.  Virutal X68000 will eventually run programs for X68000
without the ROM image.

A generic m68k emulation library is also provided.

>> STATUS

This version is still in early development phase and for developers
only.  It lacks many common instructions.

The unimplemented instructions (not all) are:

     ADDX, ANDI to CCR, ANDI to SR, DBcc, etc.

>> REQUIREMENTS

This package is written in C++ with exception handling, templates, and
namespaces.  For the best performance, a compiler that is good at
optimizing templates and inline functions is recommended.

This package uses POSIX threads.

This package uses GTK+ for GUI.

To get diagnostic log output, GNU Nana is also required.

>> INSTALLATION

See the file INSTALL in this directory for general instructions on
installation.
