List of things to do in Virtual X68000 for GTK+.  -*-Outline-*-

* Testing Screen Drawing by Mesa

Screen drawing by Mesa should be tested.  Mesa has texture scaling and
alpha blending that are missing in plain GTK+.  In addition, it could
potentially take advantage of hardware acceleration on modern video
cards.

A possible drawback of using Mesa is worse performance on older
hardware.  Can it be paid for better user interface?

* Improving The Status Bar

The status bar should be updated when the process exits.
